1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
   **I would fit my automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is because the CI guarantees every commit gets tested before any new mergers or deploys. With this everyone gets feedback without relying on local setups.**
2.  Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
   **No I would not because a unit test is faster and more clear.**

3) What is the difference between navigation and snapshot mode?
   Navigation analyzes the page right after it loads to measure performance metrics and network load. While snapshot mode analyzes a page in its current state to measure search engine optimization(SEO) and accessibility issues. Its good for seeing markup problems without waiting for the reload.

4) Name three things we could do to improve the CSE 110 shop site based on the Lighthouse results.

   **What we could do to improve is to first optimize all images by making them smaller in next gen formats. Defer non-critical scripts and remove unused code. And add a <meta name="viewport"> tag. This will enable proper mobile scaling.**
