1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
   **I would fit my automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is because the CI guarantees every commit gets tested before any new mergers or deploys. With this everyone gets feedback without relying on local setups.**
2.  Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
   **No I would not because a unit test is faster and more clear.**
